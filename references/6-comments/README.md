# Code Comments

Comments in code is simply plain text that the computer skips when looking at code. Comments are useful for writing notes for yourself or explanting what a piece of code does.

```python3
print("Hello World") # This is a comment.
# This code will be skipped by the computer.
```

Comments can be written with the `#` symbol or the `"""` symbol. We use the `"""` symbol to make multi-line comments.

```python3
"""
This is a multi-line comment and will be skipped.
This is still a comment.
And this.
And this.
"""
```

Basic tips for writing better comments:

- Use comments to explain what code does NOT how it does what it does.
- Comments should not duplicate code. If the code explains it's self then it explains it's self.
- If you can't write a good comment the problem may be in the code.
- Comments should follow proper grammar rules and end with a period.
