# Printing in python

To print something to the console simply use the `print` function. For example
take this hello world program

```python3
print("Hello World")
```
```
Hello World
```

This program takes the literal string `"Hello World"` and prints it to the console
python makes this quick and simple.

You can also print variables such as `int`s and `list`s.

```python3
x = 5
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(x, my_list)
```
```
5 
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You don't need to know what those are at this point just understand that
the print function will take almost anything and print it to the console.
