# Python Logical Operator Reference Table

Please keep in mind that this reference table was designed for Python, however many programming languages share this same syntax.

| Operator | Name | Description | Alternative Syntax |
| - | - | - |
| `and` | And | Returns `True` if both values are `True` | `&&` |
| `or` | Or | Returns `True` if either value is `True` | `||` |
| `not` | Not | Returns the inverse of the value following it | `!` |
| `==` | Equal | Returns `True` if the values are equal | Na |
| `>` | Greater Than | Returns `True` if the left value is greater than the right value | Na |
| `<` | Less Than | Returns `True` if the left value is less than the right value | Na |
| `>=` | Greater Than or Equal To | Returns `True` if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value | Na |
| `<=` | Less Than or Equal To | Returns `True` if the left value is less than or equal to the right value | Na |
| `!=` | Not Equal | Returns `True` if the left value is not equal to the right value | Na |

Exactly like the `shorthand assignment` operators the logical comparison operators compare what is to the left of them to what is to the right of them.

## Python Specific Operators

The following are more complex logical operators specific to Python. More information can be found about them later in this course.

| Operator | Name | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `is` | Is | Returns `True` if the left value is the same as the right value | Na |
| `in` | In | Returns `True` if the left value is in the right value |
